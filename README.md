Deduce X is a two player word game which is played over bluetooth. The objective of the game is to guess the other player's word by giving out an n-lettered word with no repeating characters in them. A hit count gives the number of letters in common with the word your opponent inputs. The first player to deduce the other person's word wins.

There are three modes based on the word length. A short game where the word size is 3. A normal game with word size 4 and a long game with word size of 5.

For example, if the other person’s word is “DISH”, and you start inputing words such as “STAR”, “PALM”, “CASH” and “FISH”, the corresponding hit count will be 1, 0, 2 and 3. Thus by looking at the hit count, the word can be deduced.
